##-- Adding Hero Image--##

1) By default display-flex stretches all the column items to have same height
So if we have an img tag inside our flexbox container it will stretch the image
to have equal height as other items.

2) How to fix this?

  #1 Put align-tems: flex-start; on row (But if you prefer to make row do least amount of thing possible)

  #2 Wrap the element inside a div, we dont have to give it any class. Now the div is tretching no the image.

  #3 On image we can add a class and in the css we can select it and apply align-self: flex-start;


##-- Column widths and flexbox--##

If we have content thats lower than 100% then We might have some white-space left between elements
which we can distribute by using justify-content on our row (flex-container). Space-between, center, flex-end etc
are some of the options we have.

*Justified content is on the main axis.


##-- Ensuring imgages are responsive --##

If images are not a direct child to flex container i.e. they are inside a div. They won't be responsive anymore
and we will have side scrolling issue.
To fix this we can select all the img tag in our html and apply max-width; 100%

This ensures that the iamge size is always 100% but if the parent shrinks our images will also shrink responsively.
