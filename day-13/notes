Media queries

They let us add new styles or overrride existing styles that only target
specific conditions.

we can put media-type and media-features in them.

Example:

@media media-type(media-features){

}

# If we dont' include any media-type. It will target all of them.

#600px or bigger
@media (min-width: 600px){    
}

#600px or smaller
@media (max-width: 600px){

}

#we can combine multiple features
@media(min-width: 600px) 
and (max-width: 900px){

}


#Order of things is important
It's going to be from smallest to biggest inside your media queries.
