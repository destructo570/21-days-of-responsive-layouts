##--##Module: 1.1 Percentages vs Fixed widths--##

1) Using fixed width in css elements (400px, 900px etc.)  can introduce issues
like side scrolling.
2) Instead of setting fixed width on elements we can instead use percentages
which can make our lives much easier and keep our layouts responsive.

##--Module: 1.2 Percentages on the child--##

1)If we set a fixed value (let's say for width) for a child element and when child's width
is more than the parent's width the content will overflow. We can easily fix this by using
percentage values instead of fixed values.

2)Setting percentages on an element will apply that value in relation to its parent,
So let's say we have a child element and we set it's width to 50% then this child
element will be 50% of the parent's width.


##--Module: 1.3 Why it's a good idea to avoid heights--##

1)Setting heights on elements can cause overflow issues if the content height is more
than the height set to the container it will overflow.

Solution: We can instead set padding to get some extra space for the content instead of
setting a height on the container itself.
This will solve our issue and the layout will stay responsive as well.


Takeaways:
1)By default css is responsive it's us who did something or changed something
that makes the layout unresponsive. So we should find the issue and make sure our layouts
stay responsive all the time.
2)Percentage values are your friend when creating responsive layouts.
