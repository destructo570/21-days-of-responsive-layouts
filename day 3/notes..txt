##-- Module 1.1 Adding in a max-width--##

In big screens the content can fill up the whole width adn this can cause
ux issues where the user will experience cognitive load while trying to
read the content.

To solve this issue we can add a max-width property to our content which
will result in our content only covering up the specified width.
