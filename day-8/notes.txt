##--  An introduction to flexbox  --##

1) Flexbox when applied to a parent div makes that div a flexbox container and
all the children inside that parent become flexbox items. By default
the flexbox-direction will be row. So all the child elements of flexbox container
will be laid in a row where each child is in a column.

2) By default the flexbox item's behavior is to take the least amount of space possible.
So if there are let's say 5 items in a container and all the items have a width of
100% it will try to evenly distribute it to all the items and show all of them in a
row(which can sometimes cause content to overflow since content width becomes more than the
container width)

##-- Adding spacing between columns --##

Two ways to create a gap between columns
1) Using gaps
  Ex. gap: 100px
  But this might not be widely supported for flexbox.


2) Using combinator selectors
    .col + .col{
      margin-left: 100px
    }

What this is doing is it's selecting only those columns who have an adjacent column
before them and then with those columns selected we add a margin-left for creating
spacing between the columns.
